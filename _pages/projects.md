### [CovarianceFunctions.jl](https://github.com/SebastianAment/CovarianceFunctions.jl)

Lazy, structured, and efficient operations with kernel matrices.

### [CompressedSensing.jl](https://github.com/SebastianAment/CompressedSensing.jl)

Contains a wide-ranging collection of compressed sensing and feature selection algorithms. Examples include matching pursuit algorithms, forward and backward stepwise regression, sparse Bayesian learning, and basis pursuit.

### [StochasticNeighborhoodEmbeddings.jl](https://github.com/SebastianAment/StochasticNeighborhoodEmbeddings.jl)

Computing SNE and t-SNE visualizations taking advantage of [CovarianceFunctions.jl](https://github.com/SebastianAment/CovarianceFunctions.jl)'s lazy representation of kernel matrices.

### [WoodburyFactorizations.jl](https://github.com/SebastianAment/WoodburyFactorizations.jl)

Contains an implementation of lazily represented matrix structures that allow for the application of the Woodbury Identity.

### [KroneckerProducts.jl](https://github.com/SebastianAment/KroneckerProducts.jl)

Provides an implementation of lazily represented Kronecker products with efficient in-place multiplies and solves.

### [UpdatableQRFactorizations.jl](https://github.com/SebastianAment/UpdatableQRFactorizations.jl)

Contains implementations of efficient representations of and updating algorithms for QR factorizations.

### [UpdatableCholeskyFactorizations.jl](https://github.com/SebastianAment/UpdatableCholeskyFactorizations.jl)

This package contains implementations of efficient representations and updating algorithms for Cholesky factorizations.
