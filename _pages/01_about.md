I am a PhD candidate in computer science at Cornell University, working with [Carla Gomes](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/gomes/).
My research focus is on sparse and Bayesian optimization.
On the applied side, I have collaborated with materials scientists in leveraging
[active learning for the discovery of novel meta-stable materials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAWud0uVxUQ).
After graduation, I will join Meta as a research scientist.

When I am not penciling Greek letters or
hunting down missing minus signs in code,
I enjoy cycling, dancing tango and playing the piano.
[Hear me play a tango that I transcribed here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87j4FRmfjyQ).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
